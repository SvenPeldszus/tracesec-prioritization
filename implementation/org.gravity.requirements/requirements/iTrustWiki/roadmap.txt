====== Road Map ======

Since the primary source of development is by students, the versions of iTrust are based on semesters. 





==== Source Code ====
The source code for iTrust was originally from the CSC 712: Software Reliability and Testing semester project. Since then two types of development have been made: development during semesters with students and development between semesters to refactor and redesign the code.
