====== iTrust Houskeeping ======

Between each semeseter, a bit of effort is needed to clean up the iTrust code and evaluate the state of the project. Among the types of actions are:

  * Updating automated tests
  * Fixing or clarifying the document
  * Discussions of the future of the project
  * Minor features
  * Cosmetic changes
  * Refactoring
  * Changing technologies (IDE, etc.)


===== History =====

This wiki contains somewhat of a record of the housekeeping changes made to iTrust between semesters, for posterity.

Some things just need to absolutely be done each semester.  We call these [[housekeeping requisites]].
