=====PMD and CheckStyle Settings=====

[[home_deployment_instructions|Back to home deployment]]

PMD and CheckStyle can notify you about many potential anomalies in your code. With all notifications turned on, you could receive hundreds of reports and some of those reports would be duplicate between PMD and CheckStyle. Instead, we will use custom configurations for PMD and CheckStyle.

Download the [[http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc216/common/tutorials/eclipse-install/assets/csc_pmd.xml | PMD]] and [[http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc216/common/tutorials/eclipse-install/assets/csc_checkstyle.xml | CheckStyle]] configuration files. These are the configuration files that we use for automated grading. By having a copy of these configuration files locally in Eclipse and running PMD and CheckStyle on your code, there should be no surprises during grading.
