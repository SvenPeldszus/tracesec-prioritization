====== Influenza Epidemic Detection Heuristic ======

Influenza ((loosely) based on http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/AMIA2001Tsui.pdf)
  * Influenza is ICD-9cm code is 487.x 
  * An epidemic can be "declared" if the defined threshold is exceeded for 2 or more consecutive weeks.
  * The defined threshold is exceeded when the number of incidents in a week exceeds the threshold given by the formula below.
  * The threshold for influenza is defined in the following formula where **weekNumber = week number of the current year**
<code>
    double calcThreshold(double weekNumber) {
        return 5.34 + 0.271 * weekNumber + 3.45 * Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * weekNumber / 52.0)
                + 8.41 * Math.cos(2 * Math.PI * weekNumber / 52.0);
    } 
</code>
