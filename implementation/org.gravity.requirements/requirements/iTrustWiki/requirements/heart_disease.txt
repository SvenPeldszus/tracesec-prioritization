From: http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/9/1675_57840
  * Gender. Men have greater risk than women.
  * Age. Over 45
  * Ethnicity. The risk of heart disease is greater in African American, American Indians and Hispanic Americans.
  * Obesity. If you are overweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30.
Assume any height and weight are in inches and pounds, respectively.
With the English system, calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by height in inches (in) squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703.
  * Hypertension. High blood pressure increases the risk of developing diabetes.
  * Systolic blood pressure over 240 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure over 120 mmHg.
  * Abnormal cholesterol levels. HDL ("good") cholesterol levels under 35 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) and/or a triglyceride level over 250 mg/dL increases your risk.
  * Smoking. Current or prior smoker
  * Prior diagnoses. Diabetes.
  * Family history of heart disease (mother, father, sister, brother)
