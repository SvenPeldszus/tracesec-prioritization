**UC86 Ophthalmology Surgeries**

**86.1 Preconditions**

The administrator has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system ([[uc2|UC2]]). The iTrust HCP user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system and is an Ophthalmologist ([[uc3|UC3]]). The patient must be a registered patient in the iTrust Medical Records system.

**86.2 Main Flow**

A HPC chooses to view [S2], document [S3], or edit [S4] a surgical ophthalmology office visit for an iTrust patient [S1].

**86.3 Sub Flows**

  * [S1] The HCP enters a MID [E1] or name of a patient and confirms their selection [E2].
  * [S2] A non-ophthalmologist HCP selects a surgical ophthalmology office visit from a list of prior visits. The HCP can view (but not edit) the details of the surgical ophthalmology office visit as described in in [S3]. All events are logged ([[uc5|UC5]]).
  * [S3] An ophthalmologist HCP [E3] documents the following information related to a surgical ophthalmology office visit and saves the surgical ophthalmology office visit record. All events are logged ([[uc5|UC5]]). After the surgical ophthalmology office visit record is saved, the ophthalmologist HCP is sent to an overview of all recorded surgical ophthalmology office visits for the patient. The following information may be entered, but not all is required. [E4] Data details are described in [[df17|Data Format 6.17]].
     * Date of the ophthalmology surgery office visit - current date. Required.
     * Visual Acuity Results. Required for both the right (OD) and left (OS) eyes.
     * Sphere (SPH) for both the right (OD) and left (OS) eyes. Required.
     * Cylinder (CYL) for both the right (OD) and left (OS) eyes. Optional for one or both eyes.
     * Axis for both the right (OD) and left (OS) eyes. Required for the same eye that has a cylinder reading.
     * Add for both the right (OD) and left (OS) eyes. Required.
     * Surgery Type. Optional
        * Cataract surgery
        * Laser surgery
        * Refractive surgery
     * Surgery Notes. Optional
  * [S4] An ophthalmologist HCP can return to a surgical ophthalmology office visit and modify or delete the fields of the surgical ophthalmology office visit [E3]. The event is logged ([[uc5|UC5]]). After the surgical ophthalmology office visit record is saved, the ophthalmologist HCP is sent to an overview of all recorded surgical ophthalmology office visits for the patient.

**86.4 Alternative Flows**

  * [E1] The HCP types an invalid patient medical identification number and is prompted to try again.
  * [E2] The patient chosen is not the desired patient. The HCP does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again.
  * [E3] An HCP without the ophthalmologist specialization is unable to create or edit a surgical ophthalmology office visit. They are prompted to create a regular office visit ([[uc11|UC11]]).
  * [E4] Invalid or missing inputs are flagged and an error message appropriate to the input is printed.
