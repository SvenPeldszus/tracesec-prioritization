====UC2 Create, Disable, and Edit Personnel Use Case====
==2.1 Preconditions:==
The iTrust Admin or LHCP has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3|(UC3)]].
==2.2 Main Flow:==
An admin creates a LHCP, an ER, a Laboratory Technician (LT), or a public health agent (PHA) [S1]. A LHCP creates UAPs [S2]. Once entered, the admin or LHCP is presented a detailed confirmation screen to approve.
==2.3 Sub-flows:==
  * [S1] An administrator enters a LHCP, ER, or public health agent as a user of iTrust Medical Records system, initially only the name and email are provided. A secret key is personally provided to the user, with which the user can reset his/her password. The admin must specify a specialty for a new LHCP (one of: General Physician, Heart Surgeon, OB/GYN, Pediatrician, Surgeon) and for a new LT (one of blood, tissue, or general). The data for personnel can be edited according to [[requirements:df2|Data Format 6.2]] (all fields mandatory except for associated MID and Street Address 2) [E1]. The administrator shall be allowed to assign a LHCP to multiple hospitals, and the administrator can choose among only the hospitals provided in the hospital list pull down menu. The hospital ID numbers for a LHCP are stored in the Medical Care Personnel Affiliation database ([[requirements:df8|data format 6.8]]). The administrator shall be allowed to assign a LT to a single hospital, and the administrator can choose among only the hospitals provided in the hospital list pull down menu. The hospital ID numbers for a LT are stored in the Medical Care Personnel Affiliation database ([[requirements:df11|data format 6.11]]).
  * [S2] A LHCP enters an UAP as a user of iTrust Medical Records system according to [[requirements:df2|data format 6.2]] (all fields mandatory) [E1].
==2.4 Alternative Flows:==
  * [E1] The system prompts the admin or LCHP to correct the format of a required data field because the input of that data field does not match that specified in [[requirements:df2|data format 6.2]], for HCPs.
