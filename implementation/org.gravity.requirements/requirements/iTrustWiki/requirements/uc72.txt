**UC72 View Patient Caloric and Macro-nutrient Graph**

**72.1 Preconditions**

An HCP is a registered user of the iTrust Medical Records
System (UC2). The iTrust HCP user has authenticated himself
or herself in the iTrust Medical Records System (UC3).

**72.2 Main Flow**

Any HCP may search for the patient by MID or patient name
[E1][E2]. After selecting the patient, their optimal daily caloric
and macronutrient intake is displayed according to [S1], and
the HCP can select a date to view a graph comparing that
day’s actual caloric and macronutrient intake vs the Patient’s
optimal caloric and macronutrient intake [S2]. Only HCP’s with
a specialization of “Nutritionist” may view a Patient’s calories
and macronutrients, and HCP’s may only view the calories and
macronutrients of a Patient for which they are the designated
nutritionist (UC73).

**72.3 Sub-flows**

  * [S1] The HCP shall see:
    * Carbohydrate: x%
    * Protein: y%
    * Fat: z%
    * Optimal Daily Calories: n calories
  * [S2] The HCP shall select a date for which the Patient selected has a Food Diary entry.

**72.4 Alternative Flows**

  * [E1] The HCP types an invalid medical identification number or name or a medical identification number or name of a patient not in the system and is prompted to try again.
  * [E2] The patient chosen is not the desired patient. The HCP does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again.
