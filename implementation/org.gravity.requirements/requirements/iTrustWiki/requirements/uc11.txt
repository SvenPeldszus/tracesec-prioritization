====UC11 Document office visit Use Case====
The HCP is able to document various aspects of an office visit with a patient.  The documentation uses industry-standard prescription, lab procedure, diagnosis, medical procedure, and immunization codes as defined in [[requirements:uc15|(UC15)]].
 
==11.1 Preconditions:==
An HCP is a registered user of the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc2|(UC2)]]. The iTrust user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3|(UC3)]]. 
==11.2 Main Flow:==
An HCP chooses a patient [S1] in order to document [S2] or edit [S3] an office visit.
==11.3 Sub-flows:==
  * [S1] The HCP enters a MID [E1] or name of a patient and confirms their selection [E2].
  * [S2] The HCP documents the following information related to an office visit. All events are logged [[requirements:uc5|(UC5]]. Required information is designated; all other information is optional:
     * Date (required)
     * Hospital location of the office visit, if any, (the default should be the HCP's home location) (required)
     * Notes (numbers, characters, #, ;, ?, -, ', ., :, blankspace and carriage return are all allowed input values) (required)
     * Basic Health Metrics ([[requirements:uc51|UC51]]) (required)
     * Prescribed Medications (NDC, see [[requirements:df6|Data Format 6.6]]) [S4]
     * Lab procedures that are ordered (LOINC code, see [[requirements:df11|Data Format 6.11]])([[requirements:uc26|UC26]])
     * Diagnoses (via the ICD-10CM code)
     * Medical procedures (CPT code, see [[requirements:uc15|UC15]], S1)
     * Immunizations given (CPT Code, see [[requirements:uc15|UC15]], S1)
  * [S3] HCPs can return to an office visit and modify or delete the fields of the office visit [notes, health metrics [[requirements:uc51|UC51]], prescriptions, laboratory procedures [[requirements:uc26|(UC26)]], diagnoses, procedures, and/or immunizations [[requirements:uc15|(UC15)]]]. The event is logged [[requirements:uc5|(UC5)]] and the HCP is returned in the specific office visit record to verify his or her changes. 
  * [S4] The HCP has selects a medication. The HCP provides the dosage in milligrams, the start and end date for the prescription [E3], and any special instructions. The instructions can contain numbers, characters, #, ;, ?, -, ', ., :, blankspace and carriage return. The HCP must provide instructions (can neither be empty nor the default form field value), or else they cannot add the prescription.
==11.4 Alternative Flows:==
  * [E1] The HCP types an invalid medical identification number and is prompted to try again.
  * [E2] The patient chosen is not the desired patient. The health care personnel does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again.
  * [E3] The patient may not have two active prescriptions for the same medication at any time within the specified date range.
