====== Use Case 63: Obstetrics Patient Initialization ======

===== 63.1 Preconditions =====
An HCP is a registered user of the iTrust Medical Records system ([[requirements:uc2|UC2]]). The iTrust HCP user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system ([[requirements:uc3|UC3]]). The patient associated with the obstetrics patient initialziation must by a registered patient in the iTrust Medical Records system.

===== 63.2: Main Flow =====
Any HCP may search for the patient by MID or patient name [S1][E1][E2][E3]. The history of the patient's obstetrics care is displayed as a list of patient initialization records in decending order by date (the most recent record is at the top of the list). Any HCP has the option to select an existing record to view. If the HCP selects to view an existing record, the record is shown as a read only version of the information in [S2][S3]. Only HCPs with a specialization of "OB/GYN" may create a new obstetrics record via a link or button the list of patient initializaiton records. If the OB/GYN HCP selects to add a new record, the OB/GYN HCP enters information required for the initial obstetrics patient visit including the last menstrual period (LMP) [S2] and prior pregnancies [S3]. The OB/GYN HCP submits the form and is sent to the main page for obstetric records with the listing of the patient's history of obstetrics care.

===== 63.3 Sub-flows =====

    * Day 0 of a week is the day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, ect.) of the LMP. The LMP is day zero, LMP + 1 is 0 weeks 1 day, LMP + 7 is 1 week 0 days, LMP + 8 is 1 week 1 day, etc. The obstetrics patient initialzation shows the number of weeks pregnant on the day of the record creation.
  * [S3] A prior pregnancy has the following information described in [[requirements:df14|Data Format 6.14]] [E4]. The table should be populated with information that already exists in the iTrust system, if any. The HCP adds any additional prior pregnancy information to the table.
