====== Use Case 66: Manage Pregnancy Flags ======

===== 66.1: Preconditions =====

UC 63, 64 must be fully implemented (including their pre-requisites) before UC 66 can be implemented.
===== 66.2: Main Flow =====

Flags will be either entered on a form [S4][S7] or calculated automatically based on form input
[S1][S2][S3][S5][S6][S8][S9].
==== 66.3: Subflows ====

  * [S1] - High Blood Pressure - Automatically set if the blood pressure at any visit during the current pregnancy is greater than 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic
  * [S2] - Advanced Maternal Age - Automaticly set if the mother is greater than 35 years of age
  * [S3] - Maternal allergies - Automatically retrieved from patient allergy records
  * [S4] - Low-lying placenta - Manually set by the HCP during any obstetrics visit (See UC64)
  * [S5] - High genetic potential for miscarriage - Automatically set if the patient has had at least 1 miscarriage during a previous pregnancy.
  * [S6] - Abnormal fetal heart rate - Automatically set if the FHR during any visit is < 105 or > 170 bpm (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3678114/figure/fig-1/)
  * [S7] - Twins - Set if the current pregnancy is marked as twins in the past pregnancy records
  * [S8] - RH- flag - Set if the the mother has a negative blood type.
  * [S9] - Atypical weight change - Automatically set if the patientâ€™s weight ventures outside of the numbers outlined below (see http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-weight-gain/art-20044360 )
