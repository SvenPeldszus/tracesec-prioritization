====UC4 Enter/edit Demographics Use Case====
==4.1 Preconditions:==
[[requirements:uc1|UC1]] has completed and a patient has been created. The iTrust user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3|(UC3)]].
==4.2 Main Flow:==
Demographic information is entered and/or edited [S1, S2, S3, S4]. The user is presented with a success or failure message and the form is updated so that the user may correct the form or add more information.
==43.3 Sub-flows:==
  * [S1] A patient or personal health representative may enter or edit their own demographic information including their security question/answer according to [[requirements:df1|data format 6.1]]. When answer to the security question is typed in, the answer should not appear on the screen (similar to how a password normally appears) and the answer should be confirmed (by the patient or personal health representative) before it is saved. [E1].
  * [S2] HCP must enter the MID of a patient and then enter or edit demographic information with the exception of the patient's security question/password according to [[requirements:df1|data format 6.1]] [E1].
  * [S3] An HCP may enter or edit their own demographic information according to [[requirements:df2|data format 6.2]] [E1].
  * [S4] An HCP may upload a photo of the patient as part of the patient's demographic records [E2].
==4.4 Alternative Flows:==
  * [E1] The system prompts the patient or HCP to correct the format of a required data field because the input of that data field does not match that specified in [[requirements:df1|data format 6.1]] or [[requirements:df2|data format 6.2]], as appropriate.
  * [E2] The system shall display a default placeholder image for patients who do not have a photograph on file.
